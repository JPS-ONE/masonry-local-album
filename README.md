## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded as they come into view, optimizing performance and reducing initial load times.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: The gallery adjusts to any screen size, from mobile to desktop.
- 🖼️ **Masonry Layout**: Beautiful grid layout with dynamic resizing based on image dimensions.
- 🔗 **Infinite Scroll**: New images are loaded automatically as you reach the end of the gallery.
- ✨ **Lightbox Popup**: Click on any image to view it in a full-screen popup.

### 🗂️ How It Works
- The gallery works with images stored in a **local folder**. Place your images inside a folder named `images` in the root directory of your project.
- Images should be named in a sequential format like `image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`, `image3.jpg`, and so on.
- You need to specify the total number of images you want to display by adjusting the `numImages` variable in the code.
